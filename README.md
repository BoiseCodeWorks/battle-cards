# battle-cards

Welcome to the jungle... It's time to get your game on!

You have been tasked with building out the front-end of an intense card battling game. 
The server-side team just finished up with the backend game logic for how the game works. 
To comply with these settings you will need to follow a set of specific instructions and HTTP requests.

To get started you need to know about three important routes or API endpoints.

- The baseURL: https://inspire-server.herokuapp.com/cards
	- A Node Server is waiting for requests at /cards. You will need to use the HTTP methods with the above url to build the game.

- GET: /cards
	- This will give you a list of all of the card games created. Details about the game object are below
- POST: /cards
	- This is how you create a new game... A Game Config Object is optional see below
- GET: /cards/:gameId
	- Gets the game at this Id
- PUT: /cards/:gameId
	- Edits the game state. Only accepts an attack Object... See Below
- DELETE: /cards/:gameId
	- Removes a game by its Id
	


### Setting up the Game Config
```javascript
{
	"gameConfig":{
		"playerName": "", //The player's name
		"opponents": 1 // Defaults to 1 if not specified
		"set": 2 // Card Images are generated base on game set 1-4
	}
}
```
	
### The Game Object
```javascript
{
	"id": "cdff37e5-a5e4-4596-83cd-a286983aa503", // The Game Id
	"set": 2, // valid card set themes 1-4 
	"opponets": 1, // The number of oposing players
	"players": [
		{ // First Index is always the current player
			"id": "a97decee-de95-466b-be8c-610852bb06c5", // Your Player Id
			"name": "Jake", //The players Name
			"hand": [ // No more than 5 cards in your hand at a time
				{
					"attack": 4,
					"health": 3,
					"defense": 0,
					"id": "f8e88a52-b888-467d-8423-567ea8a94855", // The cards ID
					"img": "https://robohash.org/f8e88a52-b888-467d-8423-567ea8a94855?set=set2", // An auto generated picture based on the games card set
					"dead": false // The status of the card
				}
			],
			"remainingCards": 5, // The total remaining cards yet to be drawn
			"dead": false
		},
		{
				//Another Player,
				//Oponent Names AutoGenerated
		}
	],
	"dead": [], // Players that have exhasted all of their cards
	"over": false, // The state of the game victory condition
	"winner": false // 3 states for the winner:  The player Object that wins || "Cats Game" || false
}
```

### Playing the Game (the Attack Object)
```javascript
// The only way to play a game is to send the server an attack payload
// If the payload is valid the attack will be performed... 
{
	"playerId": "",
	"playerCardId": "",
	"opponentId": "",
	"opponentCardId": ""
}
// When the server is ready
// You will recieve a ready response
```


## Requirements

### Visualization
	- Players can see their hand at all times, and see the backs of the enemy cards
	- Once an enemy card has been attacked its stats are revealed until that card is destroyed

### Functionality
	- The player does not have to manually draw new cards, thier hand will always be full until their deck is empty
	- The game is winnable/loseable and tieable
